INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
Download quakenbake folder
Move this folder into your Quake II main folder (where you'll find the quake2.exe and baseq2 folders)
Replace quake2.exe in the main Quake II folder with the one in quakenbake, I reccomend keeping the original somewhere in case you want to revert
Move the shortcut in quakenbake out to your Desktop, or wherever else you'd like it.
Start the game through the shortcut to access the mod.

CONTROLS:
Hold SPACE in air to climb up a ledge  when facing one.
Hold SPACE in air  to wallrun while roughly perpendicular to a wall
Release SPACE while in air to wall jump. 
To dismount from wallrun without jumping, move away from the wall or look away.

HINTS:
You can release space the second  you start a wallrun, or just tap jump next to a wall, to do a quick tic tac.
Walljump direction is slightly influenced by look direction.
You can chain left and right tic tacs/wallruns once each before touching the ground.
