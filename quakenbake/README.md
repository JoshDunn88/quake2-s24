INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Download quakenbake folder.
- Move this folder into your Quake II main folder (where you'll find the quake2.exe and baseq2 folders).
- Replace quake2.exe in the main Quake II folder with the one in quakenbake, I reccomend keeping the original somewhere in case you want to revert.
- Create a new shortcut and append "+set game quakenbake" (not including quotes) to the target in properties.
- Start the game through the shortcut to access the mod.

CONTROLS:
- Hold SPACE in air to climb up a ledge  when facing one.
- Hold SPACE in air  to wallrun while roughly perpendicular to a wall
- Release SPACE while on wall to wall jump. 
- To dismount from wallrun without jumping, move away from the wall or look away.
- Hold C while moving at high speed to slide
- Tap C in air shortly before landing to roll and negate fall damage

HINTS:
- You can release space the second  you start a wallrun, or just tap jump next to a wall, to do a quick tic tac.
- Walljump direction is slightly influenced by look direction.
- You can chain left and right tic tacs/wallruns once each before touching the ground.
- Check the in game help screen for advice

GENERAL PLAY:
- This mod can be used on any campaign level, or just to run around whatever maps you please.
- You gain score for killing enemies, and after all enemies in a level are killed, that score is translated to skill points used to upgrade.
- More score is gained when killing enemies in stylish ways, the options currently are high speed kills (I reccomend sliding), or kills from above
- Use blasterup command to upgrade blaster damage, each upgrade doubles damage for 200 score.
- Have fun :)
