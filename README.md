INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Download quakenbake folder.
- Move this folder into your Quake II main folder (where you'll find the quake2.exe and baseq2 folders).
- Replace quake2.exe in the main Quake II folder with the one in quakenbake, I reccomend keeping the original somewhere in case you want to revert.
- Move the shortcut in quakenbake out to your Desktop, or wherever else you'd like it.
- Start the game through the shortcut to access the mod.

CONTROLS:
- Hold SPACE in air to climb up a ledge  when facing one.
- Hold SPACE in air  to wallrun while roughly perpendicular to a wall
- Release SPACE while on wall to wall jump. 
- To dismount from wallrun without jumping, move away from the wall or look away.

HINTS:
- You can release space the second  you start a wallrun, or just tap jump next to a wall, to do a quick tic tac.
- Walljump direction is slightly influenced by look direction.
- You can chain left and right tic tacs/wallruns once each before touching the ground.
